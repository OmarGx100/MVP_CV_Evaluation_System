## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Model Configuration
To use a different Ollama model, modify the `model_name` in the `CVEvaluationSystem` class:

```python
self.model_name = "your-preferred-model"  # Change from "qwen2.5:4b"
```

### Evaluation Strictness
The system is configured for strict evaluation by default. To adjust:
- Modify the prompt in `evaluate_cv_with_llm()` method
- Adjust temperature and other LLM parameters
- Change scoring thresholds in the evaluation logic

### Logging Configuration
Logs are saved to `cv_evaluation.log`. To modify logging behavior, adjust the logging configuration in the code.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Cannot connect to Ollama"**
```bash
# Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Check if model is available
ollama list
```

**‚ùå "Model not found"**
```bash
# Pull the required model
ollama pull qwen2.5:4b
```

**‚ùå "No text could be extracted"**
- Check if CV files are text-based (not scanned images)
- Verify file format is PDF or DOCX
- Check file permissions

**‚ùå "Permission denied" errors**
- Ensure Python has write permissions to the CV folder
- Check if files are not opened in other applications

### Log Analysis
Check `cv_evaluation.log` for detailed error information:
```bash
tail -f cv_evaluation.log
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For Large CV Batches:
- Increase Ollama timeout in requests (currently 120s)
- Process files in smaller batches
- Consider using GPU acceleration for Ollama

### For Better Accuracy:
- Use larger, more capable models (if hardware allows)
- Fine-tune prompts for specific job types
- Adjust temperature and other LLM parameters
